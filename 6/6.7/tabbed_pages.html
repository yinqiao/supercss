<p>Although he showed an early talent for art and began painting his native Suffolk scenery before he left school, his great originality matured slowly.</p>
<img src="tabbed_pages/constable.jpg" alt="The Hay Wain" title="The Hay Wain" />
<p>He committed himself to a career as an artist only in 1799, when he joined the Royal Academy Schools and it was not until 1829 that he was grudgingly made a full Academician, elected by a majority of only one vote.</p>
<p>In 1816 he became financially secure on the death of his father and married Maria Bicknell after a seven-year courtship and in the fact of strong opposition from her family. During the 1820s he began to win recognition: The Hay Wain (National Gallery, London, 1821) won a gold medal at the Paris Salon of 1824 and Constable was admired by <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/delacroix/">Delacroix</a> and Bonington among others.</p>
<p>His wife died in 1828, however, and the remaining years of his life were clouded by despondency.</p>

<p>His youth was spent in Le Havre, where he first excelled as a caricaturist but was then converted to landscape painting by his early mentor <a href="http://www.codefans.net">Boudin</a>, from whom he derived his firm predilection for painting out of doors.</p>
<img src="tabbed_pages/monet.jpg" alt="Women in the Garden" title="Women in the Garden" />
<p>In 1859 he studied in Paris at the Atelier Suisse and formed a friendship with <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/pissarro/">Pissarro</a>. After two years' military service in Algiers, he returned to Le Havre and met <a href="http://www.codefans.net">Jongkind</a>, to whom he said he owed `the definitive education of my eye'.</p>
<p>He then, in 1862, entered the studio of Gleyre in Paris and there met Renoir, Sisley, and Bazille, with whom he was to form the nucleus of the Impressionist group.</p> 
<p>Monet's devotion to painting out of doors is illustrated by the famous story concerning one of his most ambitious early works, Women in the Garden (Mus&#233;e d'Orsay, Paris; 1866-67). The picture is about 2.5 meters high and to enable him to paint all of it outside he had a trench dug in the garden so that the canvas could be raised or lowered by pulleys to the height he required.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/courbet/">Courbet</a> visited him when he was working on it and said Monet would not paint even the leaves in the background unless the lighting conditions were exactly right.</p>

<p>Gogh, Vincent (Willem) van (b. March 30, 1853, Zundert, Neth.--d. July 29, 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris), generally considered the greatest Dutch painter and draughtsman after <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/rembrandt/">Rembrandt</a>.</p>

He powerfully influenced the current of <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/glo/expressionism/">Expressionism</a> in modern art. His work, all of it produced during a period of only 10 years, hauntingly conveys through its striking colour, coarse brushwork, and contoured forms the anguish of a mental illness that eventually resulted in suicide. Among his masterpieces are numerous self-portraits and the well-known <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/gogh/starry-night/">The&nbsp;Starry&nbsp;Night</a> (1889).</p>

<p>无论是今年9月份典型10个城市土地出让金收入还是今年11月份一线城市土地成交均价，都在不断飙升，土地盛宴貌似已不足以形容一线城市土地市场的高涨情绪。“创33个月以来新高”，“创45个月以来新高”，无论是今年9月份典型10个城市土地出让金收入还是今年11月份一线城市土地成交均价，都在不断飙升，土地盛宴貌似已不足以形容一线城市土地市场的高涨情绪，或许“饕餮盛宴”更为贴切？

　　据《证券日报》记者从中国房产信息集团(CRIC)获取的一份数据显示，截至到11月底，2013年年内北京、上海、广州和深圳四大一线城市土地出让金收入总额为4720.38亿元，2012年同期则为1675.55亿元，同比暴涨181.72%，创历史最高纪录。

　　“今年一线城市土地市场竞争非常激烈，甚至有部分老牌房企可能也连一幅地都抢不到，开发商对未来一线、二线城市房价走势判断的乐观程度似乎一直在打破你的认知底线。”一位龙头房企的高层人士向记者如此直言，“简直疯了！”他甚至称，或许两三年后，个别企业将出现问题。</p>

<p>Pablo Picasso, born in Spain, was a child prodigy who was recognized as such by his art-teacher father, who ably led him along.</p>
<p>The small Museo de Picasso in Barcelona is devoted primarily to his <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/P/picasso_early.html">early works</a>, which include strikingly realistic renderings of casts of ancient sculpture.</p>
<p>He was a rebel from the start and, as a teenager, began to frequent the Barcelona cafes where intellectuals gathered.</p>
<p>He soon went to Paris, the capital of art, and soaked up the works of Manet, Gustave Courbet, and <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/T/toulouse-lautrec.html">Toulouse-Lautrec</a>, whose sketchy style impressed him greatly. Then it was back to Spain, a return to France, and again back to Spain - all in the years 1899 to 1904.</p>
